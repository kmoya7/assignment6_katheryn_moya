The data used in this visualization was collected and made available by David Lightfoot and colleagues at the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research Program in southern New Mexico. The data contains  includes 14 variables for 4087 individual observations. Observations represent trapped lizards and the date, location, species, sex, age, total length, and tail condition. Following the exploratory data visualization, length comparisons between female lizards across species (Desert Grassland lizard (*Cnemidophorus uniparens*) and Colorado Checkered lizard (*Cnemidophorus tessalatus*)) through two-sample t-tests using a significance level ($\alpha$) of 0.05 throughout. Differences between groups are described by Cohen's *d* effect size.

There is a significant difference in total length difference in mean total length between female lizards for the two species. The actual mean difference in total length between these two species of female lizards is 97.29 mm, with a % difference in total length of 23.5%. Through a Cohenâ€™s d analysis, there is a large effect size, signifying that there is an important difference between the total lengths of female lizards across species.
